Interpretation

This machine learning model is used to decide whether the irrigation pump should be turned ON or OFF. The system considers crop type, soil moisture, and temperature to make decisions. Categorical data is encoded, numerical features are log-transformed, and a Logistic Regression model is trained. The model learns patterns from environmental conditions to make reliable irrigation decisions, helping conserve water while ensuring crops receive sufficient moisture.
